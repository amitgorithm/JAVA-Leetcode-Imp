# Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

 

# Example 1:

# Input: head = [1,2,3,4]

# Output: [2,1,4,3]

class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        prev = dummy

        while prev.next and prev.next.next:
            first = prev.next
            second = first.next

            # Swapping
            first.next = second.next
            second.next = first
            prev.next = second

            # Move prev two nodes ahead
            prev = first

        return dummy.next
